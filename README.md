# ToDoApp

## Introduction

Welcome to my ToDoApp. It's meant to be a simple way to quickly write down daily tasks and, once completed, to delete them. 
The only possible actions are add, edit and delete and the data is stored on Google Sheets for peristance.

### Planning
Diagram:

![website preview][assets/images/todo_diagram.png]

The concept is to design a todo application that is intuitive and requires as little learning from the user as possible. There is a strong emphasis on simplicity and it is not meant to replace more complex, project tracking tools but to have a quick option to write down a task and then, upon completion, to delete and forget it.
The lack of history is a tool used to keep our focus on getting things done rather than keeping things tracked.
